# Seabird_ForageFish_model
R Code to run models from Koehn et al. 2021 - A structured seabird population model reveals how alternative forage fish control rules benefit seabirds and fisheries. Ecological Applications

TO RUN SEABIRD RUNS WITH A FORAGE FISH PREY
- First run forage fish code Run_ForageFishmodel_Siple_etal_2019.R for both Sardine and Anchovy - saves files to your project directory for each forage fish run under different control rules. Seabird model code for Koehn et al. 2021 will load and use these files.
